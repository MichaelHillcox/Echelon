# Echelon 4
Echelon 3 is a smarter way to manage and moderate clients in a RCON server.

## About
After working on a version 3 update for echelon I run into a lot of issues with the old code base. Due to these issues I've decided to start from the begining with the intention to feature match the original Echelon as well as using common standards & implementing a much simpler and much cleaner interface :thumbsup:
